        Growing up in Melbourne Florida for most of my life, I have always held a fascination with computers ever since
        I was a kid. This fascination went from trying out different software and learning about computer peripherals
        to making programs in Python and other programming languages. In addition to coding and academics, I was also an
        active Boy Scout - participating in Troops 314 and 716 with various campouts and volunteer services. In Troop
        314 I would earn my Eagle Scout and in Troop 716 I would assist in the Phap Vu Cultural Centers' festivities as
        a volunteer, assisting with various aspects such as parking, managing concession stands, and performing drums
        for the traditional Lion dance.

        Currently, I am a computer science student at the Florida Institute of Technology, entering in August 2021 and
        expecting to graduate in May 2025. While at Florida Tech I have taken numerous classes that have expanded my
        skills at software development, and I have also participated in the Florida Tech Rescue Squad, an organization
        that is dedicated to providing medical aid to students in need. I am currently training to become a EMR with the
        squad, to help provide medical services to my fellow students at Florida Tech
